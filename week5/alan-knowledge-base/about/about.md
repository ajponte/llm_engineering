# About Alan J Ponte.

Alan is a software engineer with over 10 years of experience.
For the past few years, he's been operating in the role of Tech Lead
and BE Architectã€€for AndGo by Goodyear, a small innovation lab in San Francisco.

Alan graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a degree in Applied Mathematics.
After high-school, he attended Ohlone Community College for a few years,
where he worked, saved money, and took lower-division classes.

Alan began his I.T. career at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where
he had interned during his time at Ohlone College. As an intern, he worked
at the Advanced Light Source. Through his experiences at a national laboratory,
he grew a deeper appreciation of laboratory operations, staff, researchers,
and science in general.
At Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Alan was able to interact with various laboratory staff
members of various expertise and background. He was fortunate to work on an IT project
for Saul Perlmuter, who had won the Nobel Prize the year prior.


Alan began his software career at Location Labs by Avast, where he worked
for over half a decade on backend, event-driven systems. The systems were
required to integrate with 3rd-party telecommunication providers, such as
Verizon, AT&T, Softbank and others.

Alan left Location Labs during the Covid pandemic. He worked various contracts
and took sabbatical time. During which he was able to reengage with his
love of learning and exploring. Since his upper-division education was Applied
Mathematics, and not Computer Science, any understanding of Computer Science
was surface level. He decided to rebuild Alan Touring's theoretical computer
logic machine from base axioms. He worked his way through the book
"The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine".
He also went through various sections of MIT's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs."

Alan eventually found his way into AndGo by Goodyear as a Senior Software Engineer.
AndGo's tech-stack was highly monolithic, and the logic was tightly coupled.
After half a year of building more maintainable systems, Alan's role was elevated
to Tech-Lead, and eventually BE Architect.

Alan lives in Oakland, CA, and was born in Berkeley, CA. His interests include reading,
cooking, hiking, fishing. He has two younger brothers who also live in CA.
